    "article": "<p>Every year SIMA bids adieu to the members who successfully accomplish their education at IISc, and year 2016 was no different with a large number of people passing out this year with flying colours. This farewell was also an occasion to meet once again and have some chitchat with everyone.  In an emotionally surcharged atmosphere, each of them shared some beautiful moments that they had in IISc, and we could easily make out that for most of them it’s the wide variety of SIMA activities that added colours to their life here. It wasan overwhelming experience as we listened to them, but it’s a pleasure to know more about them, so this time we shared a Digital Autograph, where their friends scribbled some memories they had with them and to enliven the evening, we played some games. It’s not simple to execute the variety of SIMA activities without some able hands to drive, and thus it was an occasion to show our gratitude to Deekshith Krishnan, Swaroop Jacob and Nimmy P who were part of the SIMA executive committee during their stay here. Also SIMA’s existence is due to the active participation by its members in various activities all-round the year and this year’s MUDRA saw an active participation of 120  volunteers, which should be appreciated and thus we did it with our small token of appreciation. Farewell 2016 was an exceptionally wonderful evening!</p>",
