    "article": "<p>During Ramzan, Muslims observe a month of prayer and fasting, and like past years this year also SIMA organised an Ifthar party to celebrate the spirit of Ramzan.  It is the time when the SIMA members get together and eat a light meal to break the fast observed from dawn to dusk. For the group of people who observed the rigorous fast, this celebration was an opportunity to share the relevance of such an act, while for those who joined the party for some delicious snacks; it was an occasion to experience a divine aura. This Ifthar,the SIMA members had a wonderful time at cutting fruits and introducing their tastebuds to the variety of snacks, among which the highlight was the Pazhamnirachathu, an inevitable snack in the Malabar Ifthar cuisine. It was a pleasure to listen to Prof. E D Jemmis, as he passed on his Ramzan wishes and our dear friend Febin, who shared with everyone significance of Ramzan and Ifthar.</p>",
